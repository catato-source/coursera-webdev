# Introduction to Web Development
## This repository contains the application of what I have learned in this Coursera course.
Our final task is to create a site containing **Login Form** with input validation function using **JavaScript**.\
We also need to make the site **aesthetically** pleasing and this can be done using **CSS**.\
By creating this repository, I am hoping to gain deeper understanding of **git functionalities** as well.
